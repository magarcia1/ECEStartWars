* Description: Driver 2 class contains the main method of Java assignment. Star Wars is a game that 
* requires the player to move his/her selected space ship out of the way of incoming obstacles. The 
* more obstacles avoided by the player, the more points are accumulated for a player score. The score 
* will continue to increase as long as obstacles are avoided, but once an obstacle is hit by the space 
* ship, the players round is over. Controlling the space ship uses a single key to raise the space ship 
* up, and gravity will lower the spaceship back down. The user only has control of the upward and downward
* motion of the ship. In order to move the ship up, the user has to maintain the left click of the mouse 
* pressed.
